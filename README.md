## About This Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing select projects, technical expertise, and my career journey in analytics, machine learning, and Trust & Safety.

Built with React, SCSS, and modern web development tools, the portfolio is designed to be clean, mobile-responsive, and easy to update as I grow in my career. It's an upgrade from my first website on html5.

## Template Credits

This portfolio was adapted from a template originally created by [Yuji Sato](https://github.com/yujisatojr/react-portfolio-template). While attribution is not required, Iâ€™m grateful for the excellent structure and flexibility of the original template.
